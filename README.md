# DeciSure AI
*A universal AI decision-maker that explains its choices.*

## Overview
DeciSure AI is a decision-making system that takes in two options from any domain—finance, education, shopping, movies, or even daily life—and outputs a **final recommendation with reasoning**.

Unlike simple comparison tools, DeciSure AI is built to be **domain-agnostic, explainable, and adaptive**. It doesn’t just pick an option—it shows **why** it picked it, what factors influenced the decision, and even what might have changed the outcome under different conditions.

The project is designed to demonstrate both technical skills and innovation, making it suitable for recruiter showcases as well as potential **patent publication**.

## Features
- **Dual-Option Decision Making** – Compare any two inputs and receive a single recommendation.
- **Explainability Layer** – Human-like reasoning that breaks down how the decision was made.
- **Weighted Criteria Scoring** – Evaluates options across multiple factors such as cost, quality, risk, or preference.
- **Domain Adaptability** – Works across different fields with minimal modification.
- **Counterfactual Analysis** – Explains what would happen if certain factors were ignored (e.g., “If budget were not a concern, Option B would have been chosen.”).
- **Personalization** – Learns from past decisions to refine recommendations over time.

## System Architecture
1. **Input Layer** – User provides two options and (optionally) context or preferences.
2. **Decision Engine** – Uses a hybrid approach of:
   - Rule-based heuristics
   - ML/NLP-driven analysis
   - Probabilistic scoring
3. **Explainability Layer** – Generates human-like reasoning and counterfactuals.
4. **Output Layer** – Displays final recommendation, reasoning, and score breakdown.

## Example Use Cases

- **Education** – Selecting a university program.
- **Shopping** – Deciding between two gadgets.
- **Entertainment** – Picking a movie to watch.
